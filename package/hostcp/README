=============================================

* What is hostcp ?

	You can copy program/file from your TFTP server by using hostcp.
	The original hostcp was hostcat which was created by Magnus Damm.

* How to use it ?

	hostcp require /etc/hostcp.config which has TFTP server IP

	/ # cat /etc/hostcp.conf
	192.168.10.77

	If your kernel has "CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP",
	/etc/hostcp.conf will be set automatically.
	if not, set it your self.

	Of course TFTP server/platform network are required :)

	Then, you can run

	/ # hostcp foo /home

	Now file "foo" will be copied to your platform/home from TFTP-server.
